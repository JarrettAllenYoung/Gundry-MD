            <div class="accordion__info">
        <p>Active Advantage supports your health in 3 key ways:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>1. First, Astaxanthin — one of the most powerful antioxidants ever discovered — helps support mitochondria production and ramp up the energy inside your body.†</li><br>
            <li>2. Fulvic minerals and CoQ10 combine to support your ATP levels (the primary fuel source for your cells).†</li><br>
            <li>3. Tocotrienols help your body clear away the free radicals that lead to rapid aging and can deplete your energy†</li><br>
