      <div class="accordion__text">
        <div class="accordion__info">
          <p>Active Amines utilizes a special type of energizing molecule called polyamines to help you feel more energetic, sharp, and lively.</p>
          <p>Polyamines are compounds which help support autophagy — your body’s ‘cellular rejuvenation’ process. This makes polyamines key for helping keep your cells healthy and in good condition… which is vital for feeling active and energetic.</p>
          <p>These gummies also contain special prebiotic fibers derived from Baobab trees — which are one of the healthiest and most resilient types of trees in the world.</p>
          <p>Despite growing in harsh African environments, Baobabs are able to not only survive, but thrive in their harsh desert climates. How? By concentrating rare longevity-supporting supernutrients in their leaves, bark, fruit, and seeds… which are excellent for supporting human vitality, mental energy, and autophagy.</p>
