      <div class="accordion__text">
        <div class="accordion__info">
          <p>As you get older, your body’s ability to turn food into energy naturally slows down. This can lead to fatigue, brain fog, weight gain, and even muscle loss – an age-related process Dr. Gundry calls Metabolic Failure.</p>
          <p>You can think of your metabolism like a conveyor belt. When you're young, it runs fast and smooth, helping your body burn fat and stay energized. But over time, that belt slows down and backs up, making it harder to stay lean, strong, and focused.</p>
          <p>Active Biome is designed to help fight that slowdown at the source. It delivers triacetin, a concentrated form of acetate that your body turns into Acetyl-CoA – the key molecule that helps keep your metabolic conveyor belt moving.</p>
          <p>It also supports your gut – the control center of your metabolism – with powerful postbiotics like butyrate and a rare, gut-supporting probiotic called Akkermansia. Together, they help promote gut health, smooth digestion, and support a healthy weight.</p>
          <p>Together, these ingredients help re-ignite your energy, support fat burning, and promote strength and vitality from the inside out – no matter your age.†*</p>
