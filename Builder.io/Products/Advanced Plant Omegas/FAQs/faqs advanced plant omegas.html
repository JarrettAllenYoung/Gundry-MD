      <div class="accordion__text">
        <div class="accordion__info">
          <p>While it is technically possible to get omega-3 fatty acids from certain foods such as fatty fish (salmon, mackerel, sardines), flaxseeds, chia seeds, hemp seeds, and walnuts, the quantities needed would make it difficult for most people to get enough. That’s why quality supplementation is a convenient option to ensure you’re meeting your dietary needs.<sup>†︎︎*</sup></p>
