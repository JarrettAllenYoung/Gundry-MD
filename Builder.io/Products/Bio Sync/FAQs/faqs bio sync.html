        What is Bio Sync?*†

            <div class="accordion__info">
        <p>Gundry MD Bio Sync is a breakthrough age-fighting formula that uses advanced bio-nutrients to help support autophagy — the process through which our bodies “cannibalize” zombie cells and fat cells during your sleep.</p>
        <p>It works by combining the power of 3 scientifically-renowned compounds which have individually been found to support:†</p>
        <p>An easier time losing weight</p>
        <p>Clear focus, memory, and recall</p>
        <p>An increased desire to be active</p>
        <p>An elevated sense of wellbeing</p>
        <p>Reduced back, knee, and joint stiffness</p>
        <p>Improved sleep and relaxation</p>
        <p>A significantly younger, healthier-feeling body overall</p>

        What are "zombie cells" exactly?*†
            </label>
            <div class="accordion__text">
            <div class="accordion__info">
        <p>Zombie cells are cells that remain in the body even after they’ve stopped functioning. When we’re young, our bodies are able to remove zombie cells on their own through a nightly process called autophagy. But as our autophagy slows down with age, zombie cells start to accumulate faster.</p>
        <p>Due to their parasitic nature, zombie cells are now known to be the main overarching cause of nearly all major health problems, signs of aging, and weight issues. In other words, if you’ve found yourself feeling tired, stiff, overweight, or generally less healthy as you get older — zombie cells are likely the cause.</p>
        <p>That’s precisely why we formulated Bio Sync to help your body fight back against zombie cells from multiple angles, so you can feel “in your prime” at any age!</p>

            <div class="accordion__info">
        <p>Bio Sync is made using 3 primary ingredients — spermidine, PEA, and Nobiletin — all of which work with your body, and are supported by scientific research. For this reason, we believe Bio Sync to be highly beneficial to virtually all adults.</p>
        <p>We also conduct 3rd party testing on all our components to ensure their potency, so you can be sure you’re getting high-quality product. We invite you to consult with your own health care provider before starting a new supplement regimen.</p>

        Can I still take Bio Sync if I don’t want to lose weight?*†

            <div class="accordion__text">
            <div class="accordion__info">
        <p>Absolutely. After all, Bio Sync is first and foremost designed to support cellular rejuvenation — which is something everyone needs in order to stay healthy and vital as they get older. So while all of the compounds in this formula are scientifically shown to have profound weight management benefits, people who are already at their goal weight can expect to experience these effects in the form of added energy instead.</p>

        <p>Many people find that nothing has ever made them feel as young, healthy, and empowered as Bio Sync. It’s a true health breakthrough and the science behind it is bulletproof. So we are absolutely certain it can work for you as well.</p>
        <p>However, we also understand that a small percentage of people may not respond to its ingredients as intensively due to their body’s chemistry.</p>
        <p>That’s why every order will come complete with our 90-day refund promise: In the unlikely event you're not 100% thrilled with your results (for any reason whatsoever), just let us know within 90 days of use and we'll gladly reimburse your entire purchase price (minus shipping).</p>
        <p>All we ask is that you take that Bio Sync consistently during the course of your 3-month trial before making your decision —because the effects of this formula build gradually. (That means, the results you see and feel after 1 month could be even more dramatic after 2 months, and grow even stronger by month 3, and so on and so forth.)</p>
        <p>And we would hate for you to miss out on seeing just how radical your age transformation can be over time!</p>
