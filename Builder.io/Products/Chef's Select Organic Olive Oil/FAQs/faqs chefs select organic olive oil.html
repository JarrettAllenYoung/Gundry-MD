        What sets this olive oil apart from brands I find at the store?

        <p>Unlike many conventional olive oils, Chef’s Select Organic Olive Oil is harvested via first cold press — meaning it is not exposed to major heat or light. This maintains the high quality of the olives from tree to tin.</p>
        <p>In addition, each tin includes the “Pressed On” date — a step most other olive oil brands don’t include on their packaging. This way, you KNOW you’ve got the freshest, most potent, and delicious olive oil possible.</p>
