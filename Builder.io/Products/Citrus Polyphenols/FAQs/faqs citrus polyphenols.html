      <div class="accordion__text">
        <div class="accordion__info">
          <p>Polyphenols are powerful antioxidants found in plants. The two dominant polyphenols in Citrus Polyphenols are hesperidin and naringin. These are two of the most important polyphenols in cellular and cardiovascular health. They can be found in high concentrations in citrus peels.</p>
          <p>When taken in high doses, the benefits of these polyphenols can be incredible, which is why Citrus Polyphenols was formulated in the first place — so you can benefit from polyphenols every day without the need to consume tons of high-fructose fruit, or chew on tough, bitter citrus peels.</p>
          <p>After all, Polyphenols are natural energy boosters, they have antioxidant properties, and play a huge role in keeping your body healthy.</p>
