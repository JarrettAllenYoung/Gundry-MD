      <div class="accordion__text">
        <div class="accordion__info">
          <p>By using specially-selected extracts to help coat and soothe your esophagus and upper GI lining, GI Renew supports comfortable post-meal digestion. It also promotes easier breakdown of foods, a flatter stomach, and relief from gas, bloating, and occasional heartburn and abdominal discomfort after meals.</p>

      <div class="accordion__text">
        <div class="accordion__info">
          <p>While Total Restore and Lectin Shield support the mucosal lining in your lower GI tract, GI Renew targets your upper GI tract — which is equally as important for comfortable, efficient digestion.</p>
