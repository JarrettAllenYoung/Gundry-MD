      <div class="accordion__text">
        <div class="accordion__info">
          <p>The most popular order for new customers is the 2-bottle option. However, many of our longtime customers usually opt for the 3-bottle option, which gives you even greater opportunities to save, and stay “stocked up” — since this will likely become a daily staple.</p>

      <div class="accordion__text">
        <div class="accordion__info">
          <p>Gentle Botanical Cleanser was formulated with high-quality ingredients, specifically chosen to help moisturize, brighten, and firm the appearance of your skin. It should be suitable for daily use for the vast majority of people.</p>
          <p>If you have sensitive skin, you may want to do a “patch test” before using Gentle Botanical Cleanser. Simply pump a small amount out, and place it on your skin in an inconspicuous spot, like your inner elbow. If your skin becomes irritated, talk with your dermatologist or medical provider before using Gentle Botanical Cleanser on your face.</p>

        <div class="accordion__info">
          <p>Of course! Now, I’m confident my Gentle Botanical Cleanser will help your skin feel and look incredible… But I also understand everyone’s skin chemistry is different. Because of this, a small number of people might find this formula doesn’t give their skin the look they want.</p>
          <p>That’s why every single purchase of Gentle Botanical Cleanser comes with my personal 90-day guarantee. If, for any reason it does not offer you skin that feels moisturized, bright, and firm — just call our friendly customer support team to initiate a return of what you haven’t used for a full, no-questions-asked refund of your purchase price.</p>
