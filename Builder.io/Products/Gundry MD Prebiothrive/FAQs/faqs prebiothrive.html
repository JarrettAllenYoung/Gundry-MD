        Why Might I Need to Incorporate Prebiotics into My Diet?†*

        <p>Gundry MD PrebioThrive™ is packed with fiber-rich ingredients like acacia gum, agave inulin, flaxseed, and guar gum, all rich in essential prebiotics. These prebiotics, not to be mistaken with probiotics, are microorganisms that help maintain a healthy balance of beneficial bacteria (probiotics) in your gut. Probiotics naturally exist and multiply in your gut, and supplements like Gundry MD™ 24 Strain Probiotic are available to further support these beneficial bacteria in combating digestive issues brought on by factors like diet and environment. Gundry MD PrebioThrive™ is a prebiotic fiber supplement designed to foster this balance with a blend of dietary fibers that promote digestive health and regularity.</p>
        <p>From Dr. Gundry’s expert perspective, many people simply aren't consuming enough prebiotic-rich foods, leading to a deficiency of these vital gut supporters. This is where Gundry MD PrebioThrive™ comes in: it helps ensure you're receiving your prebiotics in the right quantities to make a meaningful impact on your gut health.</p>
        <p>Always talk to your healthcare provider before adding any new supplement to your routine.</p>
