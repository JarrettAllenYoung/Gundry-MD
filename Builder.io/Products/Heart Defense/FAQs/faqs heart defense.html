        How is Heart Defense any different from regular cocoa?†*

            <div class="accordion__text">
            <div class="accordion__info">
        <p>For starters, store-bought cocoa powders are heavily processed and most of the cocoa flavanols have been destroyed. All the energy-boosting and heart-protective benefits of cocoa are found in the flavanols… in high doses, to be precise.</p>
        <p>That's why for Heart Defense, we use a proprietary ingredient called Flavacoa that guarantees you 200mg of cocoa flavanols per glass. This is the exact dose shown to help dilate your blood vessels and strengthen the flow of oxygen-rich blood throughout your body.</p>
        <p>Not only that, but most store-bought cocoas are loaded with sugar and extremely high in calories – whereas Heart Defense has no sugar and only 35 calories per serving. In fact, the only thing Heart Defense has in common with regular cocoa is its smooth, rich, and delicious flavor!</p>
        <p>This is a doctor-formulated supplement with four ingredients proven to help you stay active, slim, and heart-healthy.*</p>
        <p>In addition to Flavacoa, Heart Defense contains powerful doses of Inulin, NeuroFactor™, and Flaxseed. There’s not another product on the market – in stores or online – that contains this same combination of ingredients.</p>
