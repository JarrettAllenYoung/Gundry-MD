        What’s the difference between Lectin Shield and Total Restore?†*

            <div class="accordion__info">
        <p>While Total Restore is designed to support and nourish your gut lining, it helps your body to “flush out” potentially harmful substances. Lectin Shield is designed to help “block” these substances from entering your body in the first place. These two formulas are extremely compatible and can be used simultaneously to help achieve even greater results.</p>
