        <div class="accordion__info">
          <p>Longevitine is a revolutionary first-of-its-kind longevity support formula that helps combat signs of biological aging at the cellular level where they occur.†*</p>
<p>
What makes this formula such a breakthrough is its ability to help your body fight both signs of aging (induced by lifestyle and environment), as well as those which happen naturally over the course of time, due to the loss of key antioxidants.†* 
</p>
<p>
This can result in transformative changes, such as:
</p>
<p>
✔️Easier weight management and a smaller waist-size†*
</p>
<p>
✔️Feeling  more energized during the day†*
</p>
<p>
✔️Memory, thinking, and cognition support†*
</p>
<p>
✔️Promotes healthy digestion and helps with occasional bloating and irregularity†*
</p>
<p>
✔️A distinct sense of biological age reduction all throughout your body†*
</p>
<p>
(which can be be described as feeling like you’re ‘growing younger’)</p>

      <label class="accordion__title" for="checkbox_3"> How does Longevitine work? </label>
      <div class="accordion__text">
        <div class="accordion__info">
          <p>Longevitine is created with a blend of powerful superfoods which are believed to help reactivate old Nrf2 pathways in the body, supporting the production of glutathione as it ages — which can help slow the natural aging process and support a longer healthspan than we used to think was possible.†</p>
<p>
However, Longevitine’s effects do not stop there!
</p>
<p>
To support you as you age and fight against oxidative stress caused by our environment, each capsule also contains Biological Age Reducers (or BARs) such as. 
</p>
<p>
Alitilix — a proprietary artichoke plant extract made in Italy which helps turbo-charge your weight management efforts and shrink dangerous midsection fat.†* 
</p>
<p>
Glycine — which helps complement the effects of Algevity Factor, while also supporting healthy cardiovascular function, muscle movement, and skin firmness.†*
</p>
<p>
(Plus, every dose also contains a special bioactive form of zinc — a key antioxidant and essential mineral that many adults currently do not get enough of via food or standard multivitamins.)
</p>
<p>
Together, this exclusive combination of ingredients exerts a powerful effect on the cells inside your body, surpassing every other supplement Dr. Gundry has studied…†*
</p>
<p>
So you can truly look and feel as young as modern science will allow!†*</p>

      <div class="accordion__text">
        <div class="accordion__info">
          <p>It’s easy. Simply take two capsules of Longevitine before a meal each day — and the bioactives in it will start working right away.</p>

      <div class="accordion__text">
        <div class="accordion__info">
          <p>Everyone is different, but in some cases, people start to feel the preliminary effects of Longevitine (such as increased energy, more comfortable digestion, and clear thinking) at around the two-week mark — while advanced results, like weight management , often start becoming noticeable after 1 month.†*</p>
<p>
Then, once the formula has taken hold, you can expect all of its effects to keep supporting and promoting your health and wellbeing over time.†*
</p>
<p>In other words, the longer that you take Longevitine, the better it can help support your healthspan and longevity long-term!†*</p>

         <p>Furthermore, I designed this formula to be effective for adults in any age group — which means no adult is too old to see results.†*</p>
         <p>Of course, it is always best to consult with your health provider before adding any form of supplement or substance to your daily regimen — just to be on the safe side. So, if you have any concerns, please make sure to do this before starting on Longevitine as well.</p>
