        How does MCT Wellness work?†*
            </label>
            <div class="accordion__text">
            <div class="accordion__info">
        <p>MCT Wellness works by utilizing the powerful medium-chain triglyceride — caprylic acid — in the form of an MCT oil powder. This potent MCT powder helps boost the fat-burning ketone levels in your body. The bioflavonoids from the grape seed and currant extracts act as “MCT magnifiers” by supporting the natural nitric oxide production in your system. By doing so, this helps the ketone “superfuel,” caprylic acid, travel through your body at light speed. The result can leave you with powerful health benefits you can see and feel throughout your entire body.</p>
