      <div class="accordion__text">
        <div class="accordion__info">
          <p>Your body has a built-in system for staying youthful: autophagy. It’s the natural process your cells use to clear out old, damaged components and make way for healthier, more efficient ones.</p>
          <p>Over time, this process slows down – allowing dysfunctional cells to build up. Scientists call these senescent or “zombie cells” because they’re no longer working properly but still linger in the body. Their presence can interfere with energy, digestion, immune function, and mental clarity.</p>
          <p>Mighty Cell helps reignite this critical cellular cleanup. It delivers spermidine, a rare compound shown to support autophagy, and ergothioneine — a powerful antioxidant amino acid that helps protect cells from oxidative stress and supports healthy glutathione levels.<sup>†︎︎*</sup></p>
          <p>Together with gut-nourishing prebiotic fiber and polyphenols, these nutrients support smoother digestion, cleaner energy, and full-body resilience – helping you feel stronger, sharper, and more balanced with every passing.<sup>†︎︎*</sup></p>
