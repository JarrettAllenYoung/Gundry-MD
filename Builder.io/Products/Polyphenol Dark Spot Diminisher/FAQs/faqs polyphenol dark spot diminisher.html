        Is Gundry MD Dark Spot Diminisher suitable for all skin types? Can it be used on sensitive skin?

            <div class="accordion__info">
        <p>Gundry MD Dark Spot Diminisher is quality-checked and formulated with gentle ingredients. Those who know they have sensitive skin are always advised to use caution when using any new product for the first time.</p>
        <p>If you have any concerns about how your skin will respond to a new product, I recommend doing a “patch test” before beginning regular use. Just apply a small amount of the formula on an inconspicuous area (such as the inside of your arm) and leave it on for 24 hours to see how your skin responds.</p>

        Other spot correctors I’ve tried smell horrible, like chemicals. Does yours?
            </label>
            <div class="accordion__text">
            <div class="accordion__info">
        <p>Absolutely not. Many other spot correctors smell like horrible chemicals because they’re MADE with horrible chemicals. Why do companies use those ingredients?  Quite simply - it’s faster and easier to use those chemicals than to actually take the time to find the most powerful gentle ingredients that get the best results. </p>
        <p>We, on the other hand, took our time researching and actively searching for the most effective ingredients in the world that can achieve beautiful results without harsh chemicals.</p>
        <p>Because our formula uses a powerful polyphenol blend, you won’t experience the “ink” or “bleach” smells so many other products have.</p>

        What are the potential causes for dark spots?
            </label>
            <div class="accordion__text">
            <div class="accordion__info">
        <p>Dark spots can be caused by two distinct processes occurring at the same time – one on your skin, the other beneath it. These two processes are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>1. Sun damage</li>
            <li>2. Glycation</li>
        </ol><br>
        <p>When the sun’s harmful UV rays hit your skin, your skin responds by producing melanin<sup>1</sup> – a protective molecule that helps shield skin from further damage. Melanin is also responsible for giving skin its color – more melanin means a darker tan.<sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup> But over several years, “pockets” of melanin begin to form, which contribute to forming dark spots.<sup>4</sup></p>
        <p>Glycation occurs when excess sugar in your body binds to the protein molecules in your skin, and forms what are known as Advanced Glycation End-products<sup>5</sup> – or A.G.E.s. A.G.E.s are also a major culprit when it comes to many forms of skin damage – including dark spots. Sun damage is what everyone typically thinks of as the primary cause of dark spots…but glycation is equally important…and unless you address that process as well, you probably won’t effectively diminish your dark spots.</p>
