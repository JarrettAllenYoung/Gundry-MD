        <p>Polyphenol Firm + Sculpt Cream features a three-pronged approach to help give skin a firmer, more sculpted appearance:</p>
        <p><strong>Polyphenols</strong> - We include polyphenols from naturally-derived extracts to help defend skin against  environmental pollutants. Damage from pollution, natural aging, and even weather create changes in the skin that may cause the appearance of sagging. That’s where polyphenols come in, providing your skin with the nutrients necessary to help your skin look firm, tight, and youthful.*</p>
        <p><strong>Peptides</strong> - Peptides are the building blocks of proteins — which makes them essential to the health of our protein-rich skin. These isolated special peptides are infused into our formula to help support your skin’s natural shape and give your complexion a firm, plump look.*</p>
        <p><strong>Moisture</strong> - Any truly effective “firming” solution must contain moisturizing ingredients, to help give skin a plump, smooth look and feel — and to fight the drying effect that often comes with age. That’s why I included some of the most effective moisturizing ingredients available — to help you keep skin deeply hydrated, revitalized, and smooth through the years.*</p>

        <p>Polyphenol Firm + Sculpt Cream is formulated with all skin types in mind. If you have any concerns about how your skin will respond to a new product, it is best to perform a patch test before beginning regular use. This is easily done by applying a small amount of product on an inconspicuous area (such as the inside of your arm) and leaving it on for 24 hours to see how your skin responds to the formula.</p>
