        What makes Polyphenol Reparative Serum so effective?*
            </label>
            <div class="accordion__text">
            <div class="accordion__info">
        <p>Polyphenol Reparative serum features a potent type of antioxidant (polyphenols) to help restore the loss of moisture your skin endures on a daily basis. That damage over time is what can lead to sagging, uneven complexion and wrinkles. So this serum provides the nutrients your skin needs to help it look fresh, smooth, and youthful.</p>

        <p>Apply a dime-sized amount of product twice daily to your clean, dry face and neck. I recommend giving extra attention to potential “problem” areas such as your jawline, cheeks and neck.</p>

        <p>Yes, Polyphenol Reparative Serum is formulated with all skin types in mind. But I also recognize that everyone is different and may have different reactions to any formula.</p>
        <p>If you have any concerns about how your skin will respond to a new product, it’s best to test it on a small, inconspicuous patch of skin. Make sure you leave it on for 24 hours to see how your skin responds before beginning regular use.</p>
