        Where do the olives in Olive Oil come from?†*

        <p>Polyphenol-Rich Olive Oil comes from olive trees that are cultivated in the harsh desert olive groves of Morocco. Just below Spain, Morocco’s environment stimulates a more concentrated rush of nutrients that can increase hydroxytyrosol polyphenol content. Plus, olive oil olives are cold-pressed, free of additives and preservatives, and don’t come into contact with harsh chemicals.</p>
