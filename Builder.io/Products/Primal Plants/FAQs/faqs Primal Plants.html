        Why Polyphenols?†*

            <div class="accordion__info">
        <p>The diverse array of superfoods in Gundry MD Primal Plants, like gymnema sylvestre leaf, mulberry leaf, fennel seed and broccoli, are foods high in polyphenols, a vital micronutrient. They play a HUGE role in everything from digestion to energy levels to helping your body run smoothly.</p>
        <p>And unless you’re eating dozens of different fruits, vegetables, and other foods high in polyphenols every single day, you’re probably not consuming a wide variety of these micronutrients. In Dr. Gundry's opinion, they’re the most powerful thing most people aren’t getting in their diet because 80% of Americans just don’t eat enough fruits and vegetables.</p>
        <p>Until now, it was difficult to enjoy all the benefits of polyphenols unless you spent time and money sourcing rare ingredients, and spent all day eating fruits and vegetables, nonstop. We wanted to make it easy for you to experience the power of polyphenols in your own home.</p>
