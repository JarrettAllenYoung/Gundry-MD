        What is “intestinal permeability” exactly?†*
            </label>
            <div class="accordion__text">
            <div class="accordion__info">
        <p>Intestinal permeability refers to a common phenomenon where holes in your gut lining allow harmful bacteria and endotoxins to escape into your body. One of the main culprits of these tears are the lectins in various fruits, vegetables, and grains. They can bind to the wall of your gut and then pull apart the intestinal lining. And that creates openings for foreign bodies to leave your stomach and infiltrate your bloodstream. The signs of intestinal permeability can range for different people. But if you’ve ever struggled with digestive issues, tiredness, brain fog, unhealthy food cravings, weight gain, sore joints, and even skin issues then there’s a good chance this is the root cause. The good news is, Total Restore is here to help!</p>

        <p>Total Restore is not a probiotic supplement nor does it contain any probiotic strains. While probiotics are designed to support digestive health by balancing the bacteria in your gut, Total Restore takes a completely different approach. Total Restore features a specialized blend of powerful ingredients designed to soothe and nourish your gut lining. And because Total Restore is designed to help support a healthy gut, (where probiotics “live”), it can enhance the benefits of a probiotic formula you may already be taking.</p>
