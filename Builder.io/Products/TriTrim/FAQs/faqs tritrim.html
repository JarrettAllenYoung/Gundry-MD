        How does TriTrim work?†*

            <div class="accordion__text">
            <div class="accordion__info">
        <p>TriTrim works by rebalancing the way your body breaks down carbs, fats, and sugars during digestion. By blocking enzymes in your gut (which turn junk foods into body fat), TriTrim helps “retrain” your body to gently send extra calories directly through your system. The resulting state is called a “caloric deficit,” which means your body has shifted into its peak slimming mode.</p>

        <p>Most TriTrim users report feeling slimmer and lighter after just 1 or 2 weeks, with noticeable physical results appearing around the 1 month mark. However, the most dramatic changes can kick in once your body has settled into “calorie bypass mode” for 12 weeks or longer.</p>
