        <p>Vital Reds contains only the best ingredients. The formula is made in our GMP-certified facility and tested for quality at an independent, 3rd-party laboratory. Vital Reds is artificial sweetener-free, lectin-free, soy-free, and dairy-free. Dr. Gundry made a pledge when he developed the Gundry MD line: To never sell any product he wouldn’t personally recommend to a loved one. But of course, as a physician, he knows that no supplement works for everyone.</p>

        <p>We believe that everyone can benefit from the gut-supporting ingredients in Vital Reds. That said, we are experienced enough to know that every person is different. No two people are alike. So, even though our users rave about the incredible changes they see when using Vital Reds — there are going to be some cases with fewer results. However, the great news is this: If the formula doesn’t give you the results we promise, you can get your purchase price back no questions asked. After all, our reputation is on the line here. We want every single person who comes to Gundry MD to have a completely positive experience. If you don’t feel truly remarkable results — tons more energy, a slimmer waist, and clearer thinking — I’ll give you a full refund of your purchase price. (Does not cover shipping)</p>
